## Basic concepts and tasks  
### Notebooks  
Notebooks are interactive documents that contain both code (in languages like Python, Scala, SQL, etc.) and rich-text elements. Notebooks are used for data exploration, analysis, and visualization. Users can create, edit, and execute code within notebooks.  

### Clusters  
Clusters are virtual machines that provide the computing resources for running notebooks and jobs. You can create and configure clusters based on your workload requirements. Clusters can be auto-scaled to adapt to changing workloads.
